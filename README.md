### Hi, I'm Thomas 👋

Freelance DevOps & Cloud Engineer based in Hamburg, Germany.

I design and build secure, scalable cloud and on-prem platforms for small and medium-sized enterprises — including hybrid setups with German cloud providers.

With more than 20 years in infrastructure and software engineering, my focus today is on:

- Kubernetes platform engineering
- Secure cloud & on-prem architectures
- Infrastructure as Code
- CI/CD and GitOps
- Identity & secrets management
- Compliance-ready infrastructure

## What I’m currently working on

- Multi-cluster Kubernetes environments
- High-availability GitLab and PostgreSQL setups
- Zero-trust security architectures
- AI workloads on local infrastructure (LLM / GPU based)
- Compliance automation for regulated environments

## About me

I run a homelab with multiple rack servers, experiment with new infrastructure patterns, and enjoy working hands-on with real systems.

Outside of tech: guitar, windsurfing, kitesurfing — and family life with my wife and two boys in Hamburg.
