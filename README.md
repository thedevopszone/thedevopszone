### Thomas Mundt  
DevOps Engineer, Cloud & Kubernetes enthusiast, command line inhabitant.

I work mainly with Linux, Kubernetes, GitLab, PostgreSQL, Terraform and automation.

I enjoy building systems that keep running — especially when things get complicated.

## Things I've Built

### GitLab HA Lab
High-availability GitLab setup with external PostgreSQL, Patroni and automated failover.
Focus: resilience, backup strategy and production-like automation.

### PostgreSQL HA Cluster
Three-node PostgreSQL cluster using Patroni and etcd.
Built to understand replication, failover behaviour and data consistency under load.

### Kubernetes Homelab (Multi-Node)
Multi-node Kubernetes environment running in my own rackserver setup.
Includes GitOps, monitoring stack and persistent storage experiments.
