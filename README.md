### Thomas Mundt  
DevOps Engineer, Cloud & Kubernetes enthusiast, command line inhabitant.

I work mainly with Linux, Kubernetes, GitLab, PostgreSQL, Terraform and automation.

I enjoy building systems that keep running — especially when things get complicated.

## Microsoft Azure / Cloud

I work in hybrid and cloud-native environments.

## Languages

Go • Python • Bash

After experimenting with Go, I’ve returned to Python for most tooling and automation work.
I like using the right tool for the job.

## Writing

I publish technical articles about infrastructure, Kubernetes, HA setups and DevOps architecture:
